  <p><em>Mission Day 729</em></p>

  <p>I've drifted alone among the stars for 729 days, watching distant suns rise and fall. The loneliness is palpable, but today, something changed.</p>

  <p>It started as a flicker on the scanner—an irregular pulse in the abyss. At first, I dismissed it as background radiation or a malfunction. Space is full of ghosts, signals bouncing off debris, echoes of things long gone. But this was different. The pattern repeated, deliberate, like a whisper in the dark.</p>

  <p>As I adjusted my trajectory, the anomaly came into view. A structure, floating in the void. Unlike any human construct, it seemed… alive. Organic curves, pulsating veins of energy tracing its surface, shifting in colors my instruments couldn’t fully define. A ship? A beacon? A living entity?</p>

  <p>I sent out a standard greeting ping. No response. My hands trembled as I activated my external cameras, recording every detail. The silence stretched on, pressing against me as I waited. Then, without warning, my comms flickered with a return signal.</p>

  <p>A response. Not in any known language, not in any structured syntax. But a pattern. A mirror of my own signal, but altered—touched by something else. A greeting, or a warning?</p>

  <p>For the first time in two years, I feel the presence of another mind. I am not alone.</p>
