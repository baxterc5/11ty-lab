  <h1>The Edge of Known Space</h1>

  <p><em>Mission Day 741</em></p>

  <p>I have crossed the last mapped star system. Beyond this point, no human has ever gone.</p>

  <p>The void ahead is pure darkness. No radio signals, no distant beacons. Only the faint, eerie hum of my ship's systems keeping me tethered to reality. This is uncharted space—the true frontier. No maps. No warnings. Only endless unknowns.</p>

  <p>There is an old saying among explorers: “The bravest act is to step where no footsteps have been before.” But footsteps are human things, meant for planets and soil. Out here, there is nothing to step on. Only drifting. Only silence.</p>

  <p>The last known transmission from home was 57 days ago. A burst of encoded data, a reminder that somewhere, light-years away, Earth still spins beneath familiar skies. I replay it sometimes, just to hear human voices.</p>

  <p>I should turn back. That was always the protocol—push forward to the edge, collect data, return. But something calls me forward. The black ahead is not empty; it is waiting.</p>

  <p>Last night, I saw something move. Not a comet, not debris. Something deliberate. A shimmer against the void. And then… a noise. Faint, almost imperceptible, but undeniably there.</p>

  <p>I am not alone.</p>

  <p>And I cannot turn back.</p>
